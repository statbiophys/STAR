# STAR: Single Time-point Antibody Recognition

**STAR** (Single Time-point Antibody Recognition) is a computational pipeline designed to analyze antibody repertoires from a single time point. It enables clonal assignment and antigen specificity prediction from bulk B cell receptor (BCR) data using probabilistic modeling and machine learning.

## Features

- üîç **Specificity Prediction**: Infers antigen-specific sequences from background using statistical signals.
- üì¶ **OLGA Integration**: Uses generative models of BCR recombination via OLGA.

## Repository Structure

- `Pipeline.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook walking through the full STAR pipeline.
- `all_class/`: Custom Python classes used by the notebook.
- `data_test/`: Sample datasets for testing the pipeline.
- `olga/`: Directory containing the OLGA model used for generation probability.
- `output/`: Folder where STAR saves analysis results.
